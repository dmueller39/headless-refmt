# headless-refmt

This project packages refmt and bucklescript with as little additional cruft as
possible. Based on
[bucklescript-playground](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript-playground)
and
[reason-react-playground](https://github.com/astrada/reason-react-playground).

Unless you are building an editor or REPL for reasonml/ocaml, then you probably
don't need this project. Also, the original purpose of this project is to
package the js needed to run within a JSContext on iOS. If you are looking to
build something for the browser you should probably refer to the above examples.
